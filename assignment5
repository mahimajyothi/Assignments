1.Class Division
Write a program to calculate the division/class obtained by the student when the marks obtained by a student in 5 different subjects are given as inputs.
 
The student gets a division/class as per the following rules:
Percentage above or equal to 60 - “First Class”.
Percentage between 50 and 59 - “Second Class”.
Percentage between 40 and 49 - “Third Class”.
Percentage less than 40 - “Failed”.
 
Sample Input 1:
41
45
46
40
41
Sample Output 1:
Third Class
Program:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class StudentdDivisionClass {
	

	    public static void main(String args[])
	    {
	    	/* This program assumes that the student has 6 subjects,
	    	 * thats why I have created the array of size 6. You can
	    	 * change this as per the requirement.
	    	 */
	        int marks[] = new int[6];
	        int i;
	        float total=0, avg;
	        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
			
	        
	        for(i=0; i<5; i++) { 
	           System.out.print("Enter Marks of Subject"+(i+1)+":");
	           marks[i] = scanner.nextInt();
	           total = total + marks[i];
	        }
	        scanner.close();
	        //Calculating average here
	        avg = total/5;
	        System.out.print("The student Grade is: ");
	        if(avg>=60)
	        {
	            System.out.print("First Class");
	        }
	        else if(avg>=50 && avg<60)
	        {
	           System.out.print("Second Class");
	        } 
	        else if(avg>=40 && avg<50)
	        {
	            System.out.print("Third Class");
	        }
	        else
	        {
	            System.out.print("Failed");
	        }
	    }
	}

2.Get All Elements

Write a program to get all the elements that are greater than 5 from a given input integer list.
Display it in the order as present in the array.
 
Print the elements.
Example:
Input1: [1,3,7,8,5,13]
Output1:[7,8,13]
 

Sample Input 1:
6
1
3
7
8
5
13
Sample Output1:
7
8
13
Program:
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Greater
{	public static void main(String[] args)
	{	Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);//taking input from the user by using scanner class
		System.out.println("Enter number of elements you want to enter:");
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int i;
		int [] a = new int[n];
		System.out.println("Enter array elements:"+"\t");
		//taking given elements in array and printing elements
		  for( i=0;i<n;i++) 
		  { 
			  a[i]=sc.nextInt();
			  System.out.println(a[i] + " "); 
		  }
	//loop to print greater than 5
		  System.out.println("elements that are greater than 5 are:\t");
		  for(i=0;i<n;i++) 
		  {
			  if(a[i]>5)
			{
			System.out.print(a[i] +" ");
			}
	
		  }
	}
}
Output:
 

 

3.Arithmetic Operation
Write a program to perform the user specified arithmethic operation. The program will consist of 3 parameters. First one for specifying the type of operation (+,-,*,/) and the other two are the operands upon which the operation has to be performed. Print the final output.
 
Business Rules:
 
1. The first parameter should have the values as 1,2,3 or 4. If it has any other value other than this, return -1.
2. The Second and the third parameter should be only positive numbers, else return -2.
3. If the first parameter is
 
1 --------------- Add the second and third parameter. (second+third)
 
2 --------------- Subtract the second and third parameter.(second-third)
 
3 ---------------- Multiply second and third parameter. .(second*third)
 
4 ---------------- Divide second by third parameter.(second/third)

 

Assume all outputs are Integers.

				    Multiplication [i]= a[i] * b[i];
				    Division [i] = a[i] / b[i];
				  
				}
				System.out.println("\nAdd\t Sub\t Multi\t Div");
				for (i = 0; i < Size; i++)

			emp_days=days;
			emp_name=name;
			basic_salary=sal;
